I try to do a project for myself. I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this project. This project is not good enough. But I will update and include some features later.
In this project, I had to take help from Google, Youtube, StackOverflow & some other websites. But I was learning new techniques and code formats and how to do codes
fresh and easy so that other people could easily understand my code. I plan to add 2 or 3 new vanilla JavaScript applications to this project for my regular use case.
